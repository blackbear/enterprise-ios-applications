To use it:

Create a 'licenses' directory under your project
Put script into that directory
Put each license into that directory, one per file, with filenames that end .license
Perform any necessary reformatting on the licenses. (eg. remove extra spaces at the beginning of lines, ensure that there are no line breaks mid-paragraph). There should be a blank line in-between each paragraph
Change to licenses directory & run the script
Edit your settings bundle Root.plist to include a child section called 'Acknowledgements'
